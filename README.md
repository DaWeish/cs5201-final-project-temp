### Late Assignments
If you wish to make a late submission past the deadline, 1 PM on 4/22/16, you
must email me (Billy) as you are using Git. Tell me how late your assignment will
be and when you want me to pull it down.

Note that this deadline can change. This README is not valid for use in
an argument if it were to change. Supreme Chancellor Price's word is final.

On the course syllabus you can find more details about late grades, how many
you are alloted, and their penalties.

## End of Semester
This only applies to students that use git. At the end of the semester, all of your
repositories will be deleted. I highly recommend that your code to BitBucket 
or fork it to your username.

**Please keep your code private.** This helps keep this course difficult (read: valuable)
and increases your value as a graduate. By making this repository public, you
only hurt yourself. Only good programmers get this far in this course, let's
keep it this way.

## Overwriting this Repository
Feel free to remove this README and merge in any code you have written up
until this point. This file serves no purpose other than to inform you.

## Reference Material
There is reference material available at the bottom of my website here:
